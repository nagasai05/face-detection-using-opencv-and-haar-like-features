# face-detection-using-opencv-and-haar-like-features
This face detection works on OpenCV python library along with haar-like features (based on viola jones algorithm)
This viola jones algorithm works on various procedures to detect the face
1. Haar-like features
2. Adaptive boosting 
3. Cascading
Most no of haar-like features present in images, face is recognized
